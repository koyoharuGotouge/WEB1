            <p>however the sun plays an important role in your health it helps you stay healthy.</p>
            <p>Everyone feels happier when the sun shines this is because of serotoin,the body`s happy hormone the more sun you get the more `happy hormone` the brain produces.when your serotonin level goes up,you feel happier and stronger </p>
            <p>this helps you fight everyday stress.</p>
            <p>serotonin also has a calming effect.helping you,focus better on what you are doing.Moreover serotonin helps you get a good night`s sleep because it helps the brain produce a sleep hormone.</p>
            <p>Sunshine does not just make you feel sleep better.it also helps build strong bones.As you all know it is calcium that builds strong bones and teeth.however for the body to use serotonin properly,it needs vitamin D</p>
            <p>Interestingly,the skin creates vitamin D when sunlight shines on it.the easiest way to make strong bones is to go outside and enjoy the sun.</p></strong>
